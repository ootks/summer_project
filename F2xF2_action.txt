A Mihailova subgroup of F2xF2 is a group of the form
M(H) = \{(w,v) : v = w \text{ in }H\}
where H is a quotient group of F2xF2.

If H is finitely presented, with an unsolvable word problem then M(H) has an unsolvable membership problem (and also is not finitely presented).

If H is <x_1, \dots, x_k |R_1, \dots, R_m>, then M(H) is generated by (x_i, x_i) and (1, R_i).

So, the
